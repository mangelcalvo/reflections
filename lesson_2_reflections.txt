What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates the initial metadata.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is an intermediate step to allocate the resorces that are going to be committed. It provides granullarity to commit operations.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You move to the staging area the files you want to commit. Then you compare the changes, using "git diff --staged" , you are going to commit.
