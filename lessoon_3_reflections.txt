When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For team playing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's the same reason why we prefer to commit manually. We need to control whne the changes are pulled/pushed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Use someonelse code without collaborating
Clone: Use my github repository locally
Branch: Try new features / solve bugs without modifying the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To be able to make fast- froward merge ???

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Manual communication with added notes.
