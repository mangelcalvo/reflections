When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For team playing

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's the same reason why we prefer to commit manually. We need to control whne the changes are pulled/pushed.
